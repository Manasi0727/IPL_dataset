# 🏏 IPL Data Analysis & Match Outcome Prediction (ML Project)

A complete data science project that analyzes IPL historical match data and builds machine learning models to predict match-related outcomes using structured datasets. The project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and performance benchmarking using ensemble learning techniques.
